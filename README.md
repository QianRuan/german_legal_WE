LEARNING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GERMAN WORD EMBEDDINGS FROM LEGAL AND REGULATORY TEXTS
<br>
<br>ABSTRACT
<br>Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are widely applied to automatically extract information from texts. Word embeddings (WE) which represent meaning of words in numerical form, are commonly used as a representational basis for many NLP tasks. Since available pre-trained WEs are mostly trained on general texts, NLP models using such WEs suffer difficulties to process domain specific text. To address this, this work explores possible approaches to learn domain specific word embeddings from German legal and regulatory texts. Due to the lack of standard datasets in the German legal domain, our own training corpora and an intrinsic evaluation dataset (a list of German legal analogies) were compiled at first. Subsequently, three approaches are used to train domain specific German WEs. As state-of-the-art embedding algorithms, Word2Vec and FastText are used to train WEs on the domain specific corpora respectively. The third approach is domain adaption, i.e. training pre-trained general WEs further on domain specific texts. For each approach, the effects of different system settings and hyperparameters are investigated during the training process, in order to find the best configurations. In this way, three best performing domain specific WEs are obtained. After the training process, we conduct intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations in both general and legal domain. Two pre-trained German WEs are used as baselines to be compared with our three best performing domain specific WEs. Based on these comparative evaluations, our domain specific WEs prove their superiority over the baselines regarding most of the evaluation metrics. Therefore, we finally concluded that it is worthwhile to construct domain-specific word embeddings even with a considerably smaller training corpus size.
